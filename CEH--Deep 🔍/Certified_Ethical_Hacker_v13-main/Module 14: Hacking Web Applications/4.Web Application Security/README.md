# 🛡️ Web Application Security
After learning the hacking methodologies adopted by attackers of web applications and the tools they use, it is important to learn how to secure these applications from such attacks. A careful analysis of security will help you, as an ethical hacker, to secure your applications. To do so, one should design, develop, and configure web applications using the countermeasures and techniques discussed in this section.

## Web Application Security Testing 
Web application security testing is the process of assessing an application to identify vulnerabilities, measure its resistance to threats, and evaluate overall performance under potential attacks. It is carried out by security professionals and developers to detect weaknesses early, generate reports, and apply fixes to strengthen the application’s security.

### Manual Web Application Security Testing
Manual web application security testing is the process of checking a web application by using custom test data, code, and tools to find vulnerabilities. Unlike automated scans, it focuses on business logic flaws and detailed threat analysis. Tools like SecApps, Selenium, JMeter, LoadRunner, QTP, Bugzilla, and Acunetix are often used to support this testing.

### Automated Web Application Security Testing 
Automated web application security testing uses specialized tools to quickly detect vulnerabilities during development. These tools are integrated into each stage of the process, continuously analyzing code changes and alerting developers to security issues. This ensures faster fixes and stronger protection, with tools like Ranorex Studio, TestComplete, Leapwork, Katalon Studio, and Testsigma commonly used for such testing.

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST) 
Static Application Security Testing (SAST), also known as white-box testing, analyzes an application’s source code to find security flaws before it is run. It helps developers identify vulnerabilities, check compliance with coding standards, and fix issues early in the development cycle. Tools like Codacy, JFrog, Klocwork, Checkmarx One, and PT Application Inspector are commonly used for SAST.

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) 
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a black-box testing method where the application is tested from the outside without knowing its internal structure. It analyzes running code to find vulnerabilities in areas like authentication, sessions, inputs, and scripts. DAST tools also use fuzzing by sending unexpected inputs to detect flaws. Common tools for DAST include Invicti, Acunetix, HCL AppScan, Fortify On Demand, and StackHawk.

## Web Application Fuzz Testing 
Web application fuzz testing is a black-box testing method used to find coding errors and security flaws by sending large amounts of random data, called fuzz, to the application. This helps uncover vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, XSS, SQL injection, and DoS. While attackers use fuzzing to crash applications, developers and security teams use it to test the strength and reliability of web applications against such attacks.

### Steps of Fuzz Testing 
Web application fuzz testing involves the following steps:
- Identify the target system
- Identify inputs
- Generate fuzzed data
- Execute the test using fuzz data
- Monitor system behavior
- Log defects

### Fuzz Testing Strategies 
- **Mutation-Based:** In this type of testing, the current data samples create new test data, and the new test data will again mutate to generate further random data. This type of testing starts with a valid sample and keeps mutating until the target is reached.
- **Generation-Based:** In this type of testing, the new data will be generated from scratch, and the amount of data to be generated is predefined based on the testing model
- **Protocol-Based:** In this type of testing, the protocol fuzzer sends forged packets to the target application that is to be tested. This type of testing requires detailed knowledge of the protocol format being tested. It involves writing a list of specifications into the fuzzer tool and then performing the model-based test generation technique to go through all the listed specifications and add the irregularities in the data contents, sequence, etc.

### Fuzz Testing Scenario
The diagram below shows an overview of the main components of the fuzzer. An attacker script is fed to the fuzzer, which in turn translates the attacks to the target as http requests. These http requests will get responses from the target and all the requests and their responses are then logged for manual inspection.

## Encoding Schemes 
Encoding schemes convert data into a symbolic form to hide its original meaning and ensure it is handled safely by web applications. At the receiving end, the data is decoded back to its original format. This helps applications process special characters and binary data without errors.

### Types of Encoding Schemes 
- **URL Encoding** <br>
  URL encoding is the process of converting characters in a URL into a valid ASCII format so they can be safely transmitted over HTTP. Since some characters have special meanings in URLs, they are replaced with “%” followed by their hexadecimal ASCII code. For example, “=” becomes %3d, a space becomes %20, and a new line becomes %0a. This ensures the URL is correctly interpreted by browsers and servers.

- **HTML Encoding** <br>
  HTML encoding is a method used to safely display special characters in web pages without breaking the page structure. Characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` are replaced with HTML entities such as `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;`, ensuring they are shown as text instead of being treated as HTML code. This prevents errors and helps protect against issues like code injection.

- **Unicode Encoding** <br>
  Unicode encoding is of two types: 16-bit Unicode encoding and UTF-8.
  - **16-bit Unicode Encoding** <br>
    It replaces unusual Unicode characters with "`%u`" followed by the character’s Unicode codepoint expressed in the hexadecimal format like this: `%u2215 /`
  - **UTF-8** <br>
    It is a variable-length encoding standard that expresses each byte in the hexadecimal format and prefixes it with `%`.
    - `%c2%a9` `©`
    - `%e2%89%a0`

- **Base64 Encoding** <br>
  The Base64 encoding scheme represents any binary data using only printable ASCII characters. In general, it is used for encoding email attachments for safe transmission over SMTP and also for encoding user credentials. <br>
  For example: The binary value of cake is `cake = 01100011011000010110101101100101` <br>
  converting this binary value to Base64 encoding (binary format) <br>
  Base64 Encoding: `01011001 00110010 01000110 01110010 01011010 01010001 00111101 00111101`

- **Hex Encoding** <br>
  The HTML encoding scheme uses the hex value of every character to represent a collection of characters for transmitting binary data. For, example:
  ```hex
  Hello 48 65 6C 6C 6F
  Jason 4A 61 73 6F 6E
  ```

## Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting Applications 
Whitelisting and blacklisting are security strategies used to control which applications or entities can access a system. Whitelisting allows only trusted applications, while blacklisting blocks known malicious or unwanted ones. By applying these lists, organizations can reduce the risk of attacks and keep their applications, networks, and infrastructure secure.

### Application Whitelisting 
Application whitelisting allows only approved software, libraries, plugins, and configuration files to run on a system. This prevents unauthorized or malicious programs from executing, reduces the risk of installing vulnerable applications, and offers strong protection against threats like ransomware and other malware attacks.

### Application Blacklisting 
Application blacklisting is a security method where known malicious software is blocked from running on a system or network. It works by listing harmful applications and preventing their execution, either through firewalls or specialized blocking tools. Since it focuses only on known threats, it may miss new or advanced attacks, making regular updates to the blacklist essential for protection.

### Blacklisting and whitelisting for basic URL management
URL blacklisting prevents the user from loading web pages from the blacklisted URLs. The user can access all URLs except those in the blacklist. URL whitelisting permits the users to access only specific URLs as exclusions to those that are added to the URL blacklist.

URL whitelisting is performed using the following methods:
- **Allow access to all URLs except the blocked ones:** Whitelisting can allow the users to access the rest of the network applications
- **Block access to all URLs except permitted ones:** Whitelisting can permit access to a limited list of URLs
- **Define exceptions to very restrictive blacklists:** Whitelisting lets users access schemes, subdomains of other domains, specific paths, or ports
- **Allow the browser to open applications:** Whitelisting is performed only for specific external protocol handlers so that the browser can automatically execute applications

URL blacklisting is performed using the following methods:
- **Allow access to all URLs except the blocked ones:** Blacklisting prevents users from accessing blocked websites
- **Block access to all URLs except permitted ones:** Blacklisting blocks access to all malicious URLs
- **Define exceptions to very restrictive blacklists:** Blacklisting restricts access to all URLs that are vulnerable to attacks
- **Allow the browser to open apps:** Blacklisting prevents the browser from automatically executing applications

##  How to Defend Against Web Application Attacks
Defending against web application attacks requires a mix of secure coding and system protection. This includes using WAFs or IDS to filter traffic, keeping software updated with patches, and sanitizing user inputs to stop injections. Secure coding practices like parameterized queries and stored procedures should be applied, while error messages must be limited to avoid giving attackers hints. Databases should run with least privilege accounts, and risky commands such as `xp_cmdshell` should be disabled to reduce exposure.

<p align="center">
  <img width="792" height="355" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b0cdf3-5775-473e-9e3f-521caa20fc12" />

## Best Practices for Securing WebSocket Connection
Securing WebSocket connections is critical to ensure that data transmitted between clients and servers remains confidential and protected from attacks. The following are best practices for securing WebSocket connections: 

Here’s the simplified explanation in layered format:

1. **Use wss\:// instead of ws\://** → Encrypts WebSocket traffic with TLS/SSL to keep data safe in transit.
2. **Validate Origin header** → Ensures only trusted domains can connect to your WebSocket.
3. **Token-based authentication (JWT)** → Confirms user identity before starting a WebSocket session.
4. **Role-based access control (RBAC)** → Allows only authorized users to perform specific actions.
5. **Limit message size** → Prevents attackers from sending huge messages to crash the server.
6. **Rate limiting** → Controls how many messages a client can send, blocking spam or abuse.
7. **Session timeouts** → Closes inactive WebSocket connections automatically for safety.
8. **Logging and monitoring** → Tracks all activity and alerts on suspicious behavior in real time.
9. **Use subprotocols** → Enforces structured communication rules between client and server.
10. **Check server certificates** → Ensures connections are secure and certificates are from trusted authorities.
11. **Secure libraries/frameworks** → Use updated, well-maintained WebSocket tools to reduce risks.
12. **Set security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)** → Adds extra browser-level protection for WebSocket connections.
