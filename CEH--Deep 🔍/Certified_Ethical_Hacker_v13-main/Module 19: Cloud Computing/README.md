## NIST Cloud Deployment Reference Architecture 
The figure below gives an overview of the NIST cloud computing reference architecture; it displays the primary actors, activities, and functions in cloud computing. The diagram illustrates a generic high-level architecture, intended for better understanding the uses, requirements, characteristics, and standards of cloud computing.

<p align="center">
  <img width="547" height="299" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d3c0e08-ccd1-4ea5-9eb4-ebabb01dbcad" />
</p>

The five significant actors are as follows: 
- **Cloud Consumer** <br>
  A cloud consumer is an individual or organization that uses services from a cloud service provider (CSP). They select services from the provider’s catalog, sign service contracts or service level agreements (SLAs), and pay based on usage. The SLA defines requirements like performance, security, and remedies for failures, while also outlining the consumer’s responsibilities and limitations.

The services available to a cloud consumer in the PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS models are as follows:
- **PaaS** – database (DB), business intelligence, application deployment, development and testing, and integration
- **IaaS** – storage, services management, content delivery network (CDN), platform hosting, backup and recovery, and computing
- **SaaS** – human resources, enterprise resource planning (ERP), sales, customer relationship management (CRM), collaboration, document management, email and office productivity, content management, financial services, and social networks.

- **Cloud Provider** <br>
  A cloud provider is an organization or individual that owns and manages computing infrastructure to deliver services over a network, either directly or through a cloud broker, allowing users to access computing resources remotely.

- **Cloud Carrier** <br>
  A cloud carrier acts as an intermediary that provides connectivity and transport services between CSPs and cloud consumers. The cloud carrier provides access to consumers via a network, telecommunication, or other access devices.

- **Cloud Auditor** <br>
  A cloud auditor independently examines a cloud service provider’s controls to ensure they meet security, privacy, and performance standards. By reviewing objective evidence, the auditor evaluates safeguards that protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, checks compliance with privacy laws, and verifies that the cloud services perform as expected.

- **Cloud Broker** <br>
  A cloud broker is an intermediary that manages cloud services on behalf of consumers. Instead of dealing directly with cloud service providers (CSPs), the broker handles service usage, performance, delivery, and maintains the relationship between the consumer and the CSP, simplifying cloud management.

The services provided by cloud brokers fall in three categories:
1. **Service Intermediation** → The broker adds extra features like security, monitoring, or performance improvement to existing cloud services, making them more useful for consumers.
2. **Service Aggregation** → The broker combines multiple cloud services into a single package, so users get everything in one integrated solution.
3. **Service Arbitrage** → The broker selects the best services from different providers (without fixing them together) to give consumers the most cost-effective or high-quality option.

## Cloud Storage Architecture 
Cloud storage allows organizations to store digital data on distributed servers managed by cloud providers. Users access data through APIs, web services, or applications, while providers handle availability, security, and maintenance. Its architecture includes three layers: the front-end for user access and APIs, the middleware for functions like data replication and de-duplication, and the back-end where the physical hardware resides. Cloud storage is highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and durable, with popular services including Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, Oracle Cloud Storage, and OpenStack Swift.

<p align="center">
  <img width="557" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4018d849-b95f-4d7e-86d9-9682772f1b71" />
</p>

## Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality on Cloud 
Combining virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) with cloud computing can significantly enhance performance and accessibility for these applications. VR/AR headsets and connected devices require high computing power and advanced graphics capabilities, which can be expensive to maintain locally. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, users can access multi-core CPUs and powerful GPUs remotely, reducing the need for costly hardware upgrades.

Cloud-based delivery also addresses the rapid evolution of VR/AR software and user interfaces, enabling seamless updates and consistent user experiences. Since many VR/AR applications are used intermittently, cloud services allow for flexible pay-per-use models, making them more cost-effective. Additionally, cloud environments can provide the necessary speed and processing resources to handle demanding VR/AR workloads, ensuring smooth graphics rendering, real-time interactions, and scalable deployment for both individual users and enterprise applications.

Overall, integrating VR/AR with the cloud lowers hardware costs, supports dynamic software changes, and enables scalable, on-demand access to high-performance computing resources, enhancing both usability and adoption.

## Fog Computing 
Fog computing is a distributed computing model that sits between IoT devices and the cloud, acting as an intermediary layer or “intelligent gateway.” It brings processing, storage, and analysis closer to the data sources, enabling faster and more efficient handling of large volumes of data generated by IoT devices. By connecting edge nodes to devices, fog computing enhances performance and supports quick, real-time decision-making while complementing cloud services.

### Working of Fog Computing
Fog computing uses connected devices called fog nodes, which have processing power and storage, to handle data closer to where it is generated. These nodes process IoT data at the network edge, enabling real-time analytics even with unstable Internet connections. This approach supports applications like smart cities, smart grids, connected cars, and other scenarios requiring immediate data processing.

<p align="center">
  <img width="614" height="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c804d534-61d6-4a64-be47-e1e88929aca0" />
</p>

- **High business agility:** Developers can easily and swiftly design fog instances and deploy them based on the requirement.
- **No glitches with bandwidth:** All the data are accumulated at distinct points, instead of being transmitted together to one center through a single channel, thereby avoiding bandwidth-related problems.
- **No connection loss:** The presence of several interconnected channels does not cause connection loss.
- **Elevated security:** Fog computing enhances security as the data processing is performed by numerous nodes in a complex distributed system.
- **Low operating cost:** Fog computing can drastically reduce cost through the conservation of network bandwidth as data are processed locally, instead of being sent to the cloud for analysis.
- **High power efficiency:** Edge devices run power-saving protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, or Bluetooth.

### Disadvantages:
The following are some of the disadvantages of fog computing in comparison to cloud computing.
- **Additional expenditures:** Organizations must buy additional edge devices such as routers, hubs, and gateways.
- **Complicated system:** As fog is an extra layer in the data processing and storage system, it makes the whole system complicated.
- **Constrained scalability:** Fog is not as scalable as the cloud.
